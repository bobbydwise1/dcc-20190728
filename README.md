# Daily Coding Problem 2019-07-28

####  _Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today._

_This problem was asked by Twitter._

_You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:_

    record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
    get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.

_You should be as efficient with time and space as possible._
